# employee-attrition-analysis

HR Attrition Analysis using Python, Machine Learning Models, and the IBM HR dataset. Includes EDA, predictive models, feature importance, and HR recommendations.

Employee Attrition Analysis Using Python

This project explores the IBM HR dataset to understand the factors associated with employee attrition. The analysis includes data cleaning, visual exploration, simple predictive models, and HR-focused insights.
I used:

pandas for data handling
seaborn and matplotlib for visualisations
logistic regression and random forest to explore predictive patterns

What the Project Covers

Loading and preparing the dataset
Analysing relationships between salary, overtime, tenure, commute distance, job role and attrition
Building and evaluating basic prediction models
Identifying key factors linked to employees leaving
Translating results into practical HR recommendations

Key Insights

Lower salary levels show a higher likelihood of attrition
Early-tenure and younger employees leave more frequently
Employees working overtime are more likely to quit
Longer commute distances contribute to higher attrition

Purpose

This project helped me understand how Python can support HR decision making, from exploring workforce data to identifying risk patterns and potential intervention areas.
The goal was to connect data analysis with real HR questions and produce insights that organisations can act on.
